        <h2>Saftey Saftey No Need for Hastey </h2>
            <p>I recently developed a love for motorcycles. A hobby that comes with much danger requires a lot of saftey and smart decision making for the true enjoyment of the hobby.</p>

            <pre>
            All the gear all the time
            Watch out for deer especially night time
            Stay alert don't get hurt
            Ride the speed limit or wear the orange shirt

        <h2>Personal Intrests</h2>
            <p>My main hobby is what some people would call self-improvement.
                I don’t get too deep into the whole self-improvement movement I’m just focusing on the basics till I figure out who I am and what I’m interested in. 
                This involves trying to find ways to better time manage, ways to improve overall mental and physical health, and studying and improving on the things I know I’m interested in.
                <br> <br>
                One of my secondary interests is music. As a young high school student, I attended band and tried many instruments and music programs, but I realized this is not how I enjoy music. 
                As a listener I enjoy electronic music and beats so I recently bought a keyboard to connect to my PC and I can play all my favorite type of music and sounds with it.
                Making my own electronic music and sounds as well as making electronic remixes of popular music is how I really enjoy music as an artist.
                <br><br>
                Then lastly this likely obvious already but my other hobby is motorcycle riding. To get specific with it I enjoy motorcycle adventuring. 
                Even though I own a sports bike which may not be ideal for adventuring I still like to attempt challenges where all I have is a hammock and sleeping bag and see how far I can go or what states in the U.S. I can explore.
